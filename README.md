## Assumptions:
- The data is reliable and accurate
- The demand for each product is independent of each other
- The demand for each product is stationary


## Evaluation Metric
I would recommend the use of the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric for this model. This is because RMSE is a measure of the difference between predicted values and observed values and is widely used for time series data. In addition, RMSE is easy to interpret and is not affected by the scale of the data.


## Buidling the machine learning pipeline
I would build a machine learning pipeline for this model as follows:
- Step 1: Pre-process the data to ensure that it is clean and ready for modelling
- Step 2: Train a variety of different machine learning models on the data
- Step 3: Use cross-validation to compare the performance of the different models
- Step 4: Select the best performing model
- Step 5: Use the best performing model to make predictions on the test set

## Measuring the impact of the model
I would measure the impact of the model on the company's operations by comparing the RMSE of the predictions made by the model with the RMSE of the predictions made by a baseline model. If the RMSE of the predictions made by the model is lower than the RMSE of the predictions made by the baseline model, then the model is having a positive impact on the company's operations.
